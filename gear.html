            <h2>Sony A7III</h2>
            <p>This is my first professsional camera that I have bought. I got the edition that comes with lenses. I do not use them anymore as the are not the best.
                I only got them because it was a deal for $1500 when the camera normally goes for about $2000. This camera is about 4 years old from when it was released
                and is still a beast in todays market. It comes packed with a mirrorless shutter and 24.2 MP sensor. This camera can shoot 4K 30 FPS. So it is safe to say 
                the A7 series is an excellent hybrid. It has an iso expanded from 50-20,4800 which means it is excellent in low light conditions. I do not plan on upgrading anytime
                soon. If you are intersted here is a link from a trusted buyer
                <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1394217-REG/sony_ilce_7m3_alpha_a7_iii_mirrorless.html?msclkid=5fea8b5a6c7019e1fd64e8d63b90cbcd" title="Link to buy a7II">Check out the A7II</a>

            <h2>Mavic Air 2S</h2>
            <p>Next in line from my expensive endeavor is the Mavic Air 2S. This is my drone. This bad boy put another hole in my wallet with a price of $1200. This thing can do it all.
                It has 3 modes sport, normal, and cinema all packed with different options for your prefrence. I normally prefer cinema or normal for safety precautions (not crashing the drone).
                I do reccomend getting the fly more pack which comes with extra blades, camera filter, batteries, and a charge kit for all 3 batteries. The drone probably flies for about 30 minutes
                before the return to home option kicks in and it is time to change batteries. But while you're in the air your camera can capture 20MP shots, and 4K from 24-60FPS. These take up a lot 
                of memory so also get memory card for the drone. I do not know how far it can fly away from you or how high because again this guy was $1200 dollars and replacing it is not fun. Trust me 
                I have crashed it once. It does also include many sensors around the drone, so during your flight it will automatically maneuver the objects in the way. Besides all that it is extremely
                fun to fly and I reccommend doing your research before you buy it. Here is a link to DJI's website if you're interested. <a href="https://www.dji.com/air-2s" title="Link to buy mavic air 2 s">Mavic Air 2 S</a>

                <h2>DJI Ronin RSC2</h2>
                <p>Next in line is my gimbal. This is used to stabalize my video shots and helps make everything look very smooth and cinematic. Now this is not neccessary for videography unless you have a real 
                    steady hand. I purchased the extra combo pack which comes with tool to view what you're filming on your phone. This is helpful when you cannot look down at the camera. This gimbal comes packed
                    with a lot of filming options that I have not fully understood yet. Again I am amateur. I mainly use this when I am filming any content. It is very useful and did I forget to mention a pain to balance
                    with the camera. If you are interested here is a link to my gimbal. <a href="https://www.dji.com/rsc-2" title="Link to DJI Ronin RSC2">DJI Ronin RSC2</a>

                <h2>Lenses and Filters</h2>
                <p>Lastly I am here to tell you about my Lenses and filters. I purchase my lenses from precision camera. They are an awesome all you can want in a camera shop. I have bought a total of 3 lenses.
                    I currently own two Lenses made from Tamron. They are a 3rd party company that makes lenses that fit the mount on Sony Cameras. I have done my research and they compare with Sony's overly expensive 
                    G-Master lenses. Don't get me wrong they are better than Tamron but most G-Master lenses cost more than the camera itself. So I do highly reccommend taking a look at Tamron. I have a 28-75mm lense and a 17-28mm
                    lense from them. They get the job done. They were each priced around $800. For filters I have a Tiffen Pro Mist and a standard VND filter for filming. These are all preference and not needed. 
                    Here is a link to Tamron if you are interested. They have a wide selection of lenses for all camera comapnies. <a href="https://tamron-usa.com/" title="Link to Tamron">Tamron</a>
